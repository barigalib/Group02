<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>“House Rental Management System” is a web based application.  This application stores the information of tenants, rent information of every month.  Admin and user both can use this application. Everyone can search, store and get information by having a Unique ID. Each ID / Person / User / Admin will have their own profile with sign in ID so that the information can be secured. Today we are living in the first world where everyone uses a device. Everyone uses a software or application to store data and receive information. The world is surrounded by software and applications. <br> 
Every house owner keeps record of their tenants and rent on a ledger.  Sometimes they don’t get the accurate results and it’s very hard task to record everything accurately.  Here comes our “House Rental Management System” application. A user friendly application and accessible from anywhere over the world. 
Let’s talk about the features below. 
</p>

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> <strong>Important note:</strong> It will be similar as a portal for worldwide users. Anyone can create an account under one whole building or any individual flats. Everyone will have an individual user profile. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>We decided to go with latest technologies for developing this application in order to give users a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Frontend</em></p>
<p>For the front end we will be using HTML, CSS. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Backend</em></p>
<p>We will be using PHP Programming language to build this application. PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor". PHP is a widely-used, open source scripting language. PHP scripts are executed on the server. <br>
For the framework we will be using Laravel. Laravel is a server-side PHP framework; with it you can build full-stack apps, meaning apps with features typically requiring a backend, such as user accounts, exports, order management, etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Database</em></p>
<p>We will be using MySQL Database tool.  MySQL is the most popular Open Source Relational SQL Database Management System. MySQL is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing various web-based software applications. <br>
As free server we will use XAMPP. XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP programming languages.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monetization:</p>
<p>The tenants can pay their house rent through their Bkash Account or Bank as well. Also if any user wants to pay their utility bill online, also they can use bank account or Bkash account.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Social Impacts:</p>
<p>This web application aims to track perfect record of for and house owner and house management system. There will be no conflict between house owner and the tenants every record will be valid and accurate more than a ledger book. On this rental cases there are more incidents like clashes between house owners and tenants but this applications aims to reduce all the hassles. Also to maintain an individual house this application will be mark able.  </p>
